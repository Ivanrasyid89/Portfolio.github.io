# üöó Jakarta Travel Time Prediction #
This project was organized by Yandex Hackathon, where I attended the "Linear Models in Machine Learning: Fundamentals, Applications, and Competition" course at the Digital Talent Development Center. In this project, I used the Python programming language, utilizing Google Colab, to predict travel times in Jakarta.
